# TODO -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- glabel:
    - Displaying many ROIS takes much time! Even if we just add a new one. This could come from color coding.
    - Bugs:
        - When removing ROI sometimes something can go wrong
        - The overlay of the position labels should be top layer
        - ROIs are slow
        - Check if evaluation panel runs in stereo as well

    - Reconstruction
        - Check the mathematics behind and decide if to implement or use existing module.

# DO -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DONE -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- glabel:
    - Smoothing enhancement
    - Control feature to jump in grid with up, down, left, right
    - Tracking for lightest pixel
    - XY-position view and frame
    - Crosshair
	- Introduced a state "self._current_inference" in main_window that checks what problem the current inference is
	  based on.
	- Automated laser labeling widget
	- Alpha channel for probability maps
	- Enabled error messaging from thread
	- Added and synchronized laser inference results (left panel)
	- Implemented refit functionality
	- Implemented the display of each ROI's ID (Toggle with Key Y)
	- Implemented an evaluation panel that allows to evaluate predictions with reference ROIs
